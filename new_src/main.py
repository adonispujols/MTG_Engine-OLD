# XXX Don't forget about Planechase! Super fun!
# XXX Use "_" for basic loops/not using item (not for i in range(len(iter)))
# XXX Avoid unnecessary concatenation. Use ',' not '+ " "' for spaces! (without '')
# XXX NEVER "SAFE" DELETE: It makes you *think* you don't need it, but you might of!
# XXX Assume private fields/methods, then make public if needed by OTHER objects
# ^ "Private" = strictly internal. I.e., NEVER USED outside the class or module/file
# ^ THIS INCLUDES INIT! Outside access means it still isn't *STRICTLY internal*!
# XXX Never use straight getters/setters <- use properties!
# XXX Last design failed because you thought too much about "what" and not "how"
# ^ Don't guess ahead of time what's needed! Find out by trying to do it!
# XXX Keep code compatible code with multiplayer & ai vs ai!
# XXX Always let code fail gracefully on invalid input (if reversible)!
# XXX Stay Pythonic! Throw exceptions on actual errors, rather than check ahead!
# XXX Try generalizing ai behavior to a script or so?
# XXX Maintain a complete, solid CLI to depend on during GUI dev.
# ^ This is ALWAYS our main focus, with ports made to GUI when ready.
# XXX need to handle times where you CAN play one of your opponents cards

# XXX Constantly peeking into game in init/start script is acceptable since
# ^ it's basically just a helper script to help declutter the game namespace
